Dogs communicate constantly — through body language, vocalizations, and subtle physiological changes that are invisible to the naked eye. Smart collar technology opens a window into this hidden world.

## What Biometrics Can Tell Us

Modern pet wearables can track several key health indicators:

**Heart rate variability** tells us about stress, excitement, and overall cardiovascular health. A dog that's anxious at the vet will show different patterns than one that's relaxed at home.

**Temperature changes** can signal the early stages of illness before visible symptoms appear. Even a half-degree shift, detected early, gives you a head start on treatment.

**Activity patterns** reveal your dog's baseline energy levels. A sudden drop in activity could mean pain, illness, or depression — things that are easy to miss day-to-day.

## From Data to Understanding

Raw numbers aren't useful on their own. That's where AI comes in. By learning your specific dog's patterns over weeks and months, the Whisker app can distinguish between normal variation and genuine concerns.

Think of it as having a wellness expert who knows your dog intimately, watching over them around the clock.

## Practical Benefits

- Catch health issues days or weeks before they become serious
- Share detailed health data with your vet for faster, more accurate diagnosis
- Understand how your dog responds to new foods, environments, or routines
- Track recovery after surgery or illness with real data, not guesswork

The goal isn't to replace your vet — it's to give both of you better information to work with.
