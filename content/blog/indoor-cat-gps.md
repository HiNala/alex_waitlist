If your cat goes outside — even just into the backyard — you've probably experienced that moment of worry when they don't come home on time. Cats are natural explorers with territories that can span several blocks, and their independent nature means they don't always come when called.

## The Cat GPS Problem

Traditional pet GPS trackers were designed for dogs. They're too heavy, too bulky, and too power-hungry for cats. A cat collar needs to be lightweight enough that your cat barely notices it, with a battery that lasts long enough to be practical.

The Whisker cat collar weighs just 28 grams and lasts up to 10 days on a single charge. It's designed from the ground up for feline comfort and behavior.

## More Than Just Location

Our cat collar doesn't just track location. Combined with the smart bowl, it creates a complete picture of your cat's daily life:

- **Territory mapping** — See exactly where your cat goes and how their range changes over time
- **Activity patterns** — Understand when they're most active, how far they roam, and when they rest
- **Feeding data** — The smart bowl tracks portions and meal timing, ensuring proper nutrition
- **Multi-cat support** — Each cat gets their own bowl that only opens for them, preventing food stealing

## Safety First

The collar features a safety breakaway mechanism — if it catches on something, it releases immediately. Your cat's safety always comes first.

Combined with customizable safe zone alerts, you'll know the moment your cat wanders beyond their normal territory.
