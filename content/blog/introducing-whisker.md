## A New Way to Know Your Pet

Today, we're excited to introduce Whisker — a suite of smart pet products and an AI-powered companion app designed to help you understand your pet like never before.

For too long, pet technology has been limited to basic GPS trackers that tell you where your pet is but nothing about how they're doing. We believe your pet's location is just the beginning. What if you could also monitor their heart rate? Track their activity levels and sleep quality? Detect subtle behavioral changes that might indicate a health issue before it becomes serious?

That's exactly what Whisker does.

## What We're Building

### Smart Dog Collar

Our flagship product combines five sensors in one lightweight, water-resistant collar: GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate monitor, and temperature sensor. It connects to the Whisker app via Bluetooth and LTE-M, giving you real-time data about your dog's location, vitals, activity, and behavior.

But raw data isn't useful on its own. That's where our AI comes in. Whisker's machine learning models analyze your dog's patterns over time, learning what's normal for your specific pet — so when something changes, you'll know about it before it becomes a problem.

### Cat Collar + Smart Bowl Bundle

Cat owners have different needs, and we've designed for them specifically. The Whisker Cat Collar is ultralight at just 22 grams with a breakaway safety buckle, GPS tracking, and RFID identification.

The real innovation is the Smart Bowl. It uses the collar's RFID chip to identify which cat is approaching, and only opens the lid for the correct pet. For multi-cat households, this means no more food stealing, no more dietary mix-ups, and no more guessing who ate what. The bowl tracks portions, logs feeding times, and supports scheduled meals — all visible in the app.

### The Whisker App

Every collar and bowl connects to the Whisker companion app, which serves as your pet's health dashboard. You'll see a health score based on real-time vitals, GPS tracking with safe zone alerts, an AI health chat for personalized guidance, feeding logs and nutrition tracking, and activity and sleep analysis.

The app is free with any Whisker product and works on iOS 16+ and Android 12+.

## The Pre-Sale

We're opening pre-orders with a limited run of 500 units per product — 500 dog collars and 500 cat collar + bowl bundles, for a total of 1,000 units in our first production batch.

Both products retail for $350. To reserve yours, we're asking for a $100 refundable deposit. The remaining $250 will be charged when your product is ready to ship, estimated within 3–6 months.

If at any point before shipment you change your mind, you can request a full refund of your deposit. No questions asked.

## Why Now

The sensors, connectivity, and AI models needed to build truly intelligent pet wearables have finally reached the point where they can be miniaturized, made affordable, and last long enough on a single charge to be practical for daily use.

Our dog collar gets 7 days of battery life. The smart bowl lasts 30 days on a single charge. Both charge via magnetic USB-C docks. These aren't prototypes — they're products designed for the real world of pet ownership.

## What Comes Next

After the initial pre-sale production run, we'll be expanding availability, adding new features to the app, and exploring additional products in the Whisker ecosystem. If you have ideas about what you'd like to see, we'd love to hear from you at whisker@digitalstudiolabs.com.

For now, we're focused on getting these first 1,000 units right. Every detail matters, and we'd rather take the time to make something exceptional than rush to market with something ordinary.

Welcome to the future of pet care. We can't wait to build it with you.
