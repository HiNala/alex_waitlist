Every pet owner has the same wish: to truly understand what their pet is feeling, thinking, and needing. Until now, we've relied on guesswork, occasional vet visits, and intuition.

Whisker changes that.

## Why We Built Whisker

We started Whisker because we believed pet care deserved the same thoughtful technology that's transformed human health and wellness. Your pet can't tell you when something feels off, but their body can — through subtle changes in activity, temperature, heart rate, and behavior.

Our smart collar captures these signals continuously and uses AI to translate them into insights you can actually act on.

## What Makes Whisker Different

Unlike basic GPS trackers, Whisker is a complete pet wellness platform:

- **Health monitoring** — Temperature, heart rate, and activity levels tracked 24/7
- **AI-powered insights** — Our models learn your pet's unique patterns and flag anomalies early
- **GPS + safe zones** — Real-time location tracking with customizable boundary alerts
- **Companion app** — All your pet's data in one beautiful, intuitive dashboard

## The Road Ahead

We're currently in the pre-sale phase, with collars shipping within 3-6 months. Every deposit helps us refine the hardware and software to deliver something truly special.

Join us in building the future of pet care. Your pet deserves it.
